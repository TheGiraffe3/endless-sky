			`One of the weird aliens who appear to dwell here and who seem to be in the shape of the mythic Tyrannosaurus Rex, approaches your ship as you land. When you land and start out of your ship, grabbing your sidearm and donning armor as you go, it is standing by the hatch. "Hello, fair stranger," it says. "How may I serve you on this delightful day?"`

			choice
				`	"This anomaly called a wormhole."`

				`	"Just my fancy Jump Drive."`
					goto jumpdriveentry

			`   "Interesting," says the alien. "The only one who has ever done that before is an odd ship who seemed to come from the same general direction." It fixes you with an intent gaze. "There may be something similar between your species. The ship was pink. Seen one like it?"`

			`	"If you need something to do, I have something. I have been looking for transport to <planet> in the <system> system, but so far no Jibauni captain has wanted to take Kanlanmo, which happens to be my name. I will explain, once we get there."`
			choice
				`	"Why not? There's nothing else to do."`
					accept
				`	"In the sake of establishing a good relationship, sure!"`
					accept
				`	"Of course, but unfortunately I don't have space right now. I can come back later though."`
			`"Okay," says Kanlanmo. "Chances are, I still won't have found transport, so I will be waiting here next time you come."`
				decline
			label notseen
			`	"Okay. In that case, I have another request for you. Can you take me to <planet> in the <system> system? I will mark it on your map, and explain more once we get there. Oh yes, and my name is Kanlanmo. Kanlanmo of the Jibauni."`
			choice
				`	"Of course! You can get on the <ship> right away!"`

					decline
			label wormholeentry
			`	"Oh, we have seen it," says the alien. "But it does not let our ships though. The reason for this is unclear. but to matters of more importance. We have seen an alien ship in pink markings pass through. Have you seen it, or one like it?"`

			`	You begin the story, telling everything you know about how the Alphas tried to enslave human space.`
			`	At the end, he says, "Wow. That is a long story. And I take it you are not on their side?"`

					goto friendlyalpha
			label alphasoffer
			`	"Good. Well, that just leaves one more matter to be wrapped up. Can you take me to <planet> in the <system> system? Kanlanmo of the Jibauni will be grateful."`
			choice
				`	"Of course!"`
					accept
				`	"Yes. Also, thank you for trusting me."`

			`	The alien announces, though to what you cannot see, "The stranger has been ignominiously impolite." It turns to you. "What do you say, "weirdo"? Will you apologize? Or not, and see what happens?"`
