	description "The Sheragi engines are much more than simple tubes spewing fire; they are a collection of interdependent devices, providing increased efficiency at the cost of modularity. These include a hyperdrive, an enormous fusion reactor, and the most powerful plasma engines you've ever seen. It's all examples of relatively simple technology, but they have been refined and taken to their extreme. The engines are fundamentally connected to the fusion reactor, increasing their thrust even further and thereby allowing the Emerald Sword to fly at impressive speeds, traveling through interstellar space with relative ease."

	description "To reduce reliance on supply chains during prolonged war time, this outfit contains specialized fabricators that produce simple kinetic missiles from stock materials and a small amount of stored fuel; their guidance system merely receives data from the shipboard radar. The missiles are fired in volleys of six at a time from each launcher, making them very effective at overwhelming point defenses despite their fragility. However, the low amount of fuel they carry means they can only home in on the target for about a second before they turn into unguided ammunition. Because they are manufactured on the spot, it takes a long time to reload."

The fact it is made of solid metal makes this weapon very difficult to shoot down with standard Anti-Missile systems."
